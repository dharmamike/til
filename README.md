# README

## What is this?

This is a README file that will help you better understand me and how I hope to manage.  I'd rather be upfront and intentional about who I am and why I am the way that I am to help inform my teams about what they can expect and how we can better work together.

## About Me

I’ve been working in web development and software engineering since 1997.  Prior to that I spent a year building and running a chemical and biological testing laboratory at a startup feed and fertilizer manufacturer in Mississippi.  When that job fell apart, I was fortunate to join a small graphic design startup in Houston during the early days of the world-wide web prior to the dot-com bubble.  My time in college earning a Biology degree and the time post graduation running the lab taught me problem solving and how to use the resources available to me, and even though I knew nothing about software engineering, I was able to teach myself web development and launch my 20+ year career.  That spirit of autodidactism inspires everything I do.

Even so, like most software developers, I haven’t worked in isolation, and I know I wouldn’t have made it this far without great teammates and managers.  That’s why I’ve chosen to move into engineering management.  I value teamwork and collaboration more than any other aspect of what we do as professional software developers.  The best managers I have had — whether at startups or enterprise companies — have been people who cared for and supported the people within the teams they managed.  My goal is to be that kind of manager for others.

## This I believe

### 1:1s

Our 1:1 meetings are for you.  Certainly there are times I’ll add things to the agenda that need to be communicated, but in general, the meeting is for you to talk about whatever is on your mind.  They aren’t meant to be status meetings, but if you want to communicate status, that’s fine.  However, I think status can usually be reported outside of 1:1s in normal team meetings (e.g. standups, planning) or ad hoc in Slack (more on this below).  

The most useful 1:1s I had as an IC were those where feedback was given and received and my manager helped me figure out what I needed to do to grow in my career.  To that end, please come prepared with questions or at least a general idea of what you want to get out of it. Better yet, create a developmental plan for what you want to accomplish within the next year, and let’s use that as a framework.  We could certainly work on the creation of that plan together during 1:1s too!

### Pop-up calls/meetings

Slack.  It needs to cut us all some slack, amirite?  It can be more nerver-wracking for some people than others to have a person just message you “can we talk?”  without some sort of indication of what needs to be discussed.  I will try to always provide context if I ping you in Slack to ask for an impromptu meeting.  Please do the same for me.  In fact, we should just do that for every one of our coworkers.  

I try to make use of the status indicators in Slack to communicate here/away/busy and ask that you do the same.  I don’t let Slack manage those for me (with the exception of calendar integration) and I have been known to be online while marked as “away” or vice versa, but for the most part you can gauge my availability via slack.  If you’re unsure, ping me (with context), but  let’s not forget that Slack is an async tool.  Yes, it’s faster than email and we might expect a quicker response, but it’s still async.  

### Agile Methodology

I’ve worked at big companies and small companies, startups and well-established enterprises.  All of them have had some weird hybrid of waterfall and agile software development processes.  I like to think of agile with a small A in the way it was originally conceived of by its creators.  Read the manifesto at [https://agilemanifesto.org/](https://agilemanifesto.org/) but don’t forget about the associated [12 principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).  I believe this philosophy should guide everything we do because I’ve seen it work.  Most of all:

> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
> 

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
